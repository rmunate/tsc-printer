## Project Discontinuation Notice

### Dear Community,

After much consideration, we have decided to discontinue this project. We highly recommend exploring the available SDK options at [TSC Printers Downloads](https://usca.tscprinters.com/es/descargas).

### Recommended Alternatives

For those seeking alternatives, we suggest the following:

- **Primary Recommendation**: Use .NET
- **Secondary Recommendation**: Use Python

Both of these options are most effective when run on Windows, utilizing the appropriate DLLs.

### Reasons for Discontinuation

Our experience with implementing this project using native PHP and Laravel revealed several significant challenges. These issues have led to instability, making it difficult to maintain reliable software.

The SDKs provided include documentation for a PHP project dated (2019-07-17). However, the protocols outlined are outdated and not suitable for current development needs.

We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to consider the recommended options for a more stable and efficient development experience.

Best regards,
The Project Team
